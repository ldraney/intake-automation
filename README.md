- Status

## Next Steps

1. **Fix dropdown API calls** - research Monday.com docs for correct property names
2. **Create Monday.com form view** - link to intake board
3. **Test form submission workflow** 
4. **Build export template** for signable documents
5. **Connect to existing CRM flow** (Contacts â†’ Accounts)

## The Vision

**Proposed Onboarding Flow:**
1. **Discovery call with Paul** â†’ sends intake form link
2. **Client fills Monday.com form** â†’ auto-populates Intake board
3. **Lucas reviews** â†’ generates proposal with pricing/timeline
4. **Internal meeting** â†’ feasibility check
5. **Final call** â†’ sign contract  
6. **Invoice sent** â†’ project kickoff with Mari

**Goal:** Stop losing deals to intake form friction. Make the sales process fast and professional.
